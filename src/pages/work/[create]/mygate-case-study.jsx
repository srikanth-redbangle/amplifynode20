                MyGate is a smart, technology-forward security solution that
                helps gated communities manage their security needs including

                However, there was a lack of enthusiasm amongst security guards
                around the new technology. With the onground security forces
                forming an important part of the user group, MyGate needed to
                build a positive association between its app and the security
                guards.

                Typically, security guards in India are from smaller towns, work
                long hours, are an ignored support system and are not tech
                savvy. They saw the MyGate app as yet another chore - when in
                fact it was also built to make their work easier.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 leading-7 mb-[30px]">
                With security guards being integral to product adoption, it was
                crucial that MyGate create a positive association with this user
                group, drive app usage and demonstrate app effectiveness.
                Therefore, the first step was to acknowledge their contributions
                and restore social respect. This led to the creation of the
                central idea, #HeroesatMyGate, which aimed to recognize the
                sacrifices that guards make to ensure our safety and well-being.
                The marketing campaign illustrated authentic scenarios within
                apartment complexes, highlighting the treatment of security
                guards. We seamlessly integrated MyGate&apos;s brand name into
                the campaign message.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 leading-7">
                The campaign humanized security guards and highlighted their
                importance, resulting in a positive response from both security
                guards and apartment residents. The guards also began to
                perceive MyGate as their partner, which led to an improved
                adoption of the app.

                Sanganeri block printing, with its delicate floral motifs and
                400-year legacy, remains one of India’s most treasured crafts.
                Rooted in the migration stories of the Chippa community and
                enriched by royal patronage, Sanganeri textiles are celebrated
                for their intricate Buta, Buti, Bel, and Jaal patterns.

                Taneira, known for championing Indian weaves and techniques,
                wanted to showcase the heritage, history, and cultural context
                of Sanganeri printing in detail, while also showing how
                Taneira’s design thinking, sustainable practices, and
                collaborations with artisans are helping reimagine the craft for
                contemporary India.

                The film focused on the craft itself. Its rich history and
                evolution, along with detailed sequences of block carving, dye
                preparation, pinning, printing, and finishing. Guided by
                Taneira’s designer Priyanka, her narration brought a personal
                perspective on what makes Sanganeri prints special and how
                designing with them feels like a collaboration across time. It
                also highlighted how Taneira sustains this heritage through fair
                collaboration with artisans, sustainable practices, and design
                interventions that keep Sanganeri prints relevant for today’s
                customers.

                With a lean crew and a tight one-day schedule, the project was
                directed virtually - an approach that kept production agile
                without compromising on detail or warmth. Each frame was planned
                to feel rich and inviting, capturing intricate textures,
                gestures, and the atmosphere of the workshops. Because we were
                filming artisans immersed in their work, the team took care to
                keep the process smooth and unobtrusive, allowing authentic
                moments to unfold naturally.

                A warm folk score layered with natural sounds of the printing
                process made the experience feel both immersive and
                contemporary. We filmed on location in Sanganer and at Taneira’s
                Bangalore store to connect heritage with the brand’s modern
                retail story.

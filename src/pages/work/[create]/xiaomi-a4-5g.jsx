                                The Redmi A4 5G was about to be launched as India’s most affordable truly 5G smartphone. Priced under ₹10,000 and powered by the global debut of the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 processor. With premium features packed into an entry-level device, the A4 5G was set to change what people expected from a budget smartphone.

                                A product built for <i>Bharat</i> - the students, first-jobbers, and small business owners in Tier 2 and 3 cities. People who heavily depend on their mobile phones, who are ambitious, value-conscious, and eager to move fast, to get ahead.
                            </p>

                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mt-[30px]">
                                Xiaomi wanted a launch campaign that would connect with this audience, reflect their Bharat, and help drive early traction.

                        </div>

                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mb-[30px]">

                                We took a narrative-driven approach - rooting the product in a story that felt familiar to <i>Bharat</i>. At the centre of the film are two characters many would recognise: a father running a quiet, old-school bakery that’s losing pace with the world, and his son Raghu - disconnected, disinterested, and glued to his phone. But one day as he endlessly scrolls, an idea sparks. Raghu begins to reimagine what the family business could become.

                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mb-[30px]">

                                With the Redmi A4 5G in hand, he becomes a one-man brand team - shooting content, designing logos, creating reels, and giving the bakery a full makeover. He rebrands his father’s old <i>Babu Raj Bakery</i><span className="pl-2" />into the sleek, new BRB Café - a space that feels young, fresh, and built for today. Soon, customers start flocking in, and the business begins to pick up again. Each key feature of the phone - its 50MP camera, smooth 120Hz display, and powerful Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 processor - is woven into the story as a tool that enabled the transformation of this small business.

                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mb-[30px]">

                                Shot in Hindi and adapted to 8 regional languages, the film is fast-paced, relatable, and rooted in everyday ambition - designed to connect with the young minds of Bharat who are ready to take charge, if given the right tools.

                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mb-[30px]">

                                At the heart of it is a clear message: with speed, vision, and the Redmi A4 5G - <i>Ab India karega 5G</i>.

                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] mb-[30px]">

                                And oh, we crafted the campaign with the same speed: going from brief to creative concepts, scripts, production, 3D animations, master films, language adapts and 136 versions for various platforms in 22 days flat.
